Industry 4.0 has had substantial implications for information systems, as shown by the 2018 British Airways (BA) data breach. Affecting over 400,000 customers, this incident led to significant financial penalties and reputational damage for BA. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) ultimately imposed a £20 million fine on BA, citing a failure to comply with GDPR data protection standards (ICO, 2020). The attack was carried out using a ‘Magecart’ exploit, a type of skimming attack in which attackers injected malicious code into BA’s website to intercept customer payment details during transactions. This vulnerability was intensified by inadequate security protocols, such as a lack of multi-factor authentication and unsecured storage of administrator credentials (Wired, 2019; CPO Magazine, 2020).

This incident underscores the double-edged nature of Industry 4.0; while the digital integration it offers is transformative, it requires a heightened focus on cybersecurity. The BA breach illustrates how lapses in data protection can result in significant fines, eroded consumer trust, and long-term reputational costs. In response to these risks, companies must implement proactive data security measures like subresource integrity checks (MDN Web Docs, 2024), real-time system monitoring, and regular cybersecurity audits (Data Protection Network, 2020). These safeguards are essential for aligning with Industry 4.0’s emphasis on building secure, resilient digital ecosystems that protect both operational continuity and consumer trust in an increasingly interconnected world.
