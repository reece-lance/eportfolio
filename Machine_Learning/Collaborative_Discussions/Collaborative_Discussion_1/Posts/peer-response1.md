Thank you, Panagiotis, for sharing your thoughts on the TSB Bank collapse. I completely agree that such failures highlight the critical need for risk assessments and contingency plans when managing information systems in Industry 4.0. It's interesting to see how, despite all the advancements in automation and system integrations, human errors or improper planning can still have catastrophic consequences, especially in highly regulated sectors like finance (Edser and Peachey, 2022).

One approach to avoid such failures is the adoption of DevOps practices within financial institutions. By fostering collaboration between development and operations teams, DevOps enables continuous monitoring and quick detection of potential issues before they escalate into system-wide problems (Kim et al., 2020). Moreover, integrating AI-driven predictive maintenance could help banks and other organisations proactively identify system vulnerabilities, thus minimising the risk of similar issues.

Additionally, I believe that TSB’s situation might have been improved by using containerisation technologies (Check Point, n.d.) like Docker, which can isolate applications and ensure smoother, more reliable system transitions. This technique is becoming more popular in sectors where uptime is critical. What are your thoughts on integrating DevOps and containerisation in banking as a potential solution?
