Mateusz, I found your post on the Schreiber Foods ransomware attack fascinating, especially your emphasis on the vulnerability of interconnected systems in Industry 4.0. As you pointed out, the interconnectivity that powers so many industrial processes also can leave companies exposed to system-wide disruptions if just one endpoint is compromised (Shepel, 2021).

One way in which companies can protect themselves is by employing Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), which assumes that every connection, both inside and outside the network, is a potential threat (Rose et al., 2020). By implementing ZTA, industries like food manufacturing can minimise the risk of lateral movement within their systems, limiting the potential damage caused by ransomware.

Additionally, introducing AI-based threat detection systems can help identify unusual patterns of behaviour, enabling real-time responses to cyber-attacks (Bécue et al., 2021). While ransomware remains a constant threat, combining these proactive security measures with network segmentation could mitigate the impact of such attacks in the future. What are your thoughts on integrating AI-driven solutions with existing security protocols in industries like food production?
