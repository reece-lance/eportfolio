# Collaborative Discussion Summary: Legal and Ethical views on ANN applications

---

## Overview
This section summarises my participation in the second collaborative discussion, which focused on comparing the GDPR's security standards with similar data protection laws in the UK, particularly the ICO guidelines. The discussion highlighted the need for appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as encryption and access controls, to secure personal data, and considered the growing risks related to anonymisation and re-identification.

## Key Points from Peer Feedback
1. **Re-identification Risks**: My peers, Dalbir and Dinh, raised insightful points about re-identification risks associated with anonymised data. They expanded on my concerns by highlighting real-world cases where supposedly anonymised datasets had been re-identified. This led to a deeper exploration of whether anonymisation provides long-term security or if organisations should focus more on encryption and stricter access controls to manage personal data securely. We discussed how encryption, combined with access controls, might offer more consistent protection compared to anonymisation alone, which can be vulnerable to re-identification attacks.

2. **Divergence of UK Data Protection**: Another peer, Ben, highlighted the growing divergence between the UK’s Data Protection Act and the GDPR, particularly concerning breach notifications and specific guidance for smaller organisations. This conversation helped me consider how future updates to the UK’s laws might complicate cross-border compliance, especially for organisations that operate in both the UK and EU.
