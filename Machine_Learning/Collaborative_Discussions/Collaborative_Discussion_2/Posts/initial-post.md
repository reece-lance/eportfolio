An AI writer is a system designed to generate human-like text based on a file, using Artificial Intelligence. It uses complex machine learning techniques to create responses which are contextually relevant and coherent, assisting in tasks such as the composition of emails, articles, songs, or general day-to-day duties (Hutson, 2021). This post poses the potential benefits and risks associated with using these systems.

AI writers can significantly improve productivity by answering customer queries or generating reports; an example of this being used in a professional capacity is ChatGPT’s ability to summarise legal documents and generate code (Valliani, 2024). This automation enables users to focus on decision making and creativity, given its ability to generate poems, stories, and other compelling narratives (Jenni AI, 2024).

Additionally, these systems support inclusivity by assisting non-native speakers or people with limited writing skills (Jenni AI, 2024). They excel in idea generation and presenting diverse perspectives, enriching creative processes.

A major risk of using AI writers can be demonstrated by GPT-3’s racial, gender, and cultural stereotypes in their outputs, caused by biases in training data (Electronics, 2023). These biases can misinform or support harmful societal prejudices. Yejin Choi, a University of Washington computer scientist, describes these systems as “a mouth without a brain”, suggesting accuracy and contextually appropriate responses should be questioned, given their ability to lead to errors in sensitive domains like healthcare or legal documentation, which could cause harm to many people.

Ethically, there are risks involved in the use of AI writers, such as their ability to be weaponised to spread fake news, extremist propaganda, or large-scale phishing content, which can have a huge negative impact on society (DataRobot, 2020).

AI writers, such as those of OpenAI, hold transformative potential across various professional areas, and in day-to-day life. However, these benefits must be balanced against ethical and technical risks. Addressing biases, implementing robust content moderation, and fostering human-AI collaboration rather than substitution are critical measures to ensure their responsible use (Chan, 2022). The use of AI writers should be in moderation, and in situations where the responses will not have a large effect on people’s lives; over-reliance on these tools may decay human creativity and critical thinking over time.
