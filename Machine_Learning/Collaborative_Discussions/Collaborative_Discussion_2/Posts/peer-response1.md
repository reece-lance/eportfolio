Hello Munro,

Your discussion on the risks of misinformation and the challenges of regulating training data is highly relevant. I’d like to expand on this by examining the ethical implications of generative AI in journalism. Research highlights how generative AI could unintentionally create "filter bubbles," where biases in training data amplify misinformation and reinforce existing societal divisions (Cinelli et al., 2021). This highlights the urgent need for ethical guidelines in industries such as journalism and content creation.

Additionally, while your point about productivity is well-taken, there’s an overlooked challenge: over-reliance on AI could hinder creativity. Research by Vainikka et al. (2024) highlights how AI’s reliance on existing patterns can lead to a "flattening" of unique ideas, especially in creative industries. To counter this, industries might focus on leveraging AI as a tool for idea generation rather than a replacement for human creativity.

Do you think stricter industry-specific AI guidelines could mitigate risks without diminishing the productivity benefits you mentioned?
