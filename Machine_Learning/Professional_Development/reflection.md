# Reflective Piece: Machine Learning Module

## Introduction

This module has been an invaluable learning experience, allowing me to expand my understanding of ethical, legal and professional challenges, and improving my technical skills. This reflective piece covers, my technical skill development, teamwork and professional growth, using Rolfe et al.'s (2001) "What? So What? Now What?" structure.

## Technical Knowledge and Skill Development

During this module, I used machine learning techniques which were supervised, such as linear regression, and unsupervised, like clustering. The Airbnb project involved analysis of business data to identify New York neighbourhoods with untapped potential for growth. We worked on comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and applying K-Means clustering. These tasks aligned perfectly with the learning objectives of applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets.

Solving this real-world problem gave me a better understanding of different techniques. Clustering algorithms, while using the Elbow Method helped to divide neighbourhoods effectively. Furthermore, the CIFAR-10 object recognition project expanded my understanding of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), their design, training and evaluation. These processes provided insight into difficulties of optimisation and performance evaluation, reflecting the bias-variance trade-off, crucial when tuning a model’s parameters.

Exposure to these projects has improved my knowledge of model design and evaluation, and the preprocessing of data. My engagement in these tasks demonstrates the practical application of theoretical data science concepts.

In the future I aim to strengthen my skills with deeper research into advanced machine learning techniques, such as hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods (Dietterich, 2000). Moreover, I would like to reinforce my ability in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch to improve my model development. This will enhance my technical skill set and prepare me to tackle challenges of a higher complexity.

## Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues

The legal and ethical implications of artificial neural networks (ANNs), through collaborative discussions on the 4th Industrial Revolution, have emphasised the importance of ethical considerations in machine learning. During a discussion with peers, I highlighted the consequences of deficient cybersecurity measures in Industry 4.0, using the 2018 British Airways (BA) data breach as an example, an incident which underscored the double-edged nature of digital integration of having transformative potential but being more vulnerable to cyber threats.

In a separate discussion forum, I also discussed the ethical issues of AI writers having bias in training data and their over-reliance on AI for making decisions, paired with a lack of corporate transparency. This encouraged further discussions on the societal implications of AI.

These discussions helped to broaden my perspective on the responsibilities of data scientists, and feedback from peers deepened my perception of the need for certain cybersecurity measures. Panagiotis Mourtas’ emphasis on human oversight and risk assessment crucialness, and Mateusz’ thoughts on Zero Trust Architecture, highlights the need to balance innovation with robust security frameworks, especially when resources are constrained.

Similarly, Stuart Gibb helped me to recognise the ethical risks of biases in AI writer outputs, and the importance of accountability in AI systems, which was pointed out by Rodrigo Pereira Cruz’s emphasis on corporate transparency and issues with monopolistic control. These discussions align with the legal and ethical frameworks in literature, such as the emphasis on fairness and protection made by GDPR. Additionally, Barocas et al.’s (2019) concept of algorithmic fairness influenced my thoughts on AI’s mitigating biases.

To continue to have an up-to-date understanding of these topics, I will continue to research AI’s ethical guidelines and legal frameworks as they evolve. I will also ensure my work aligns with ethical guidelines by prioritising fairness and bias mitigation techniques. Furthermore, I will promote supporting frameworks like the EU AI Act and advocate for transparency and accountability in the development of AI.

## Collaboration and Teamwork

Collaboration and Teamwork requires effective communication, task delegation and joint problem-solving, skills I demonstrated during the Airbnb team project. To ensure clear and constant updates between the team, I initiated and encouraged regular team discussions through a WhatsApp group, and created a GitHub repository to organise our work. This helped us to sync deadlines, progress and expectations, preventing miscommunication and delays.

My personal contributions to this project included proposing the chosen business question, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and using key techniques such as K-Means clustering. I also was responsible for creating multiple insightful visualisations such as interactive clustered maps showing supply and demand across boroughs in New York. I performed statistical analysis and ANOVA tests to determine differences in prices.

This shows how crucial it is to be able to balance technical contributions with teamwork, to ensure efficiency and a balanced workload. The received feedback complimented the methodology and techniques used; however, commented on the narrative of the report as an area for improvement. Moreover, we could have further elaborated on the business question and visualisations.

These insights underscore the importance of always focussing on improvement and adapting to challenges, which comes with clear communication; these align with collaborative learning theories which focus on diverse perspectives and shared responsibilities (The University of Edinburgh, 2024). Balancing individual contributions lead to team success, according to Belbin’s (2010) team role theory.

In the future I will continue to enhance my skills in project management and aim to adopt agile methodologies to increase efficiency and improve team dynamics. I will also learn to improve my communication skills to always ensure I collaborate effectively and speak clearly in diverse professional environments. To make sure my future visualisations present useful and actionable insights, I plan to refine my business analysis methodology.

## Personal and Professional Development

This module helped me to enhance my critical thinking skills and ability to problem solve, contributing to my professional growth beyond just technical skills. The project feedback provided areas to make improvements to my knowledge of business analysis and advanced visualisations.

I am now more confident in using my data science skills to solve real-world tasks, ensuring communication of finding to stakeholders of technical and non-technical backgrounds. This aligns with industry best practices of applying strategic thinking, communication and technical skills to solve problems.

I will continue to seek opportunities to present my findings to diverse audiences of different backgrounds, from more complex data science projects. Continually learning and engaging in professional development will be crucial to ensure I grow in this field and improve my ability to convey technical insights clearly.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Machine Learning module has given my technical, ethical and teamworking skills, which are necessary for a career in this field. This reflection has helped me to establish a clear action plan to keep my professional growth on track and identified area for improvement. It has instilled my continuous learning mindset and enhanced my machine learning skills.
