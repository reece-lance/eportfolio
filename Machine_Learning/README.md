### Development Team Project

#### Overview

This project focused on analysing Airbnb’s business data using a data science approach. Our team investigated which neighborhoods in New York City show untapped potential for growth in Airbnb listings based on demand, pricing, and availability trends. To answer this, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), data pre-processing, and applied machine learning techniques such as clustering to identify patterns. The analytical report, supported by visualisations and concise interpretations, aimed to address this challenge and provide actionable recommendations for Airbnb’s strategic decision-making. All code and supplementary artefacts were included as appendices, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

*[Examples of my work](./Team_Exercises/README.md)*

#### Feedback Received:
- **Strengths:**
  - The business question was well-chosen and relevant to Airbnb's operations.
  - The methodology was solid, demonstrating a good understanding of data analysis, EDA, and machine learning techniques.
  - The analysis was well-executed, with correctly applied clustering and statistical techniques.
  - The report was well-structured, making it accessible for Airbnb executives.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - The business question could have been elaborated further, exploring more implications and alternative analytical directions.
  - The rationale behind the question needed more depth, ensuring a more coherent strategy.
  - The business impact analysis was good but could have been expanded to highlight additional insights.
  - Visualisations could have been more extensive, leveraging Python’s full capabilities to support the analysis.
  - The report's narrative and formal tone could have been strengthened, improving clarity and professional presentation.

#### Evaluation of Project

This project strengthened my ability to use data science techniques in a structured, business-driven context and was a critical learning experience. Our collaboration skills were excellent, allowing us to derive insights from the dataset by successfully conduct EDA, clustering and statistical analysis. The report was very well structured and our methodology was good, however, we could have explored the business question and its impact a little deeper. Furthermore, some more advanced visualisation would have helped to enhance our findings. Overall, I am proud of our team's effort and will learn from this feedback to refine my approach in future analytical projects.

### Meeting Notes

A summary of notes made during meetings with my peers:

- **Finalised Business Question:** Agreed to analyse which neighborhoods in NYC show untapped potential for Airbnb listings based on demand, pricing, and availability trends.
- **Task Assignments:** Delegated EDA to myself and Raluca, while Stuart and Yassir focused on data preprocessing.
- **Data Challenges:** Discussed handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring dataset consistency before clustering analysis.
- **Clustering Approach:** Decided on using K-Means and Elbow Method to segment neighborhoods and identify investment opportunities.
- **Report Structure:** Agreed to keep findings concise, focusing on key insights and visualisations to stay within the 1000-word limit.
- **Final Submission Plan:** Ensured all artefacts, including code, visualisations, and appendices, were reviewed before submitting on time.

### Individual Project: Neural Network Models for Object Recognition

#### Overview

This project involved the development of a neural network for object recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset comprises 60,000 colour images categorised into 10 distinct classes, such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more. The project focused on data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation to assess the model's efficacy in classifying these images. The neural network was designed using convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by dense layers for classification. Data augmentation techniques were applied to improve the model's generalisation capabilities, and various performance metrics were used to evaluate the results.

*[Examples of my work](./Team_Exercises/README.md)*

#### Evaluation of Project

This project significantly enhanced my understanding of convolutional neural networks and their application in image classification tasks. Through hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, I developed a deeper appreciation for the complexities involved in machine learning projects. The feedback received highlighted areas for improvement, particularly in fine-tuning model parameters and exploring more sophisticated techniques. Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience, reinforcing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems and contributing to my professional development in the field of data science.
