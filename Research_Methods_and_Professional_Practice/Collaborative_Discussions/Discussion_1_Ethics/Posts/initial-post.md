The dark UX patterns case involves issues that break principle rules from the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics and the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct. A web developer by the name of Stewart, was asked to design a website with features with the purpose of misleading users into making accidental expensive purchases. All of his concerns surrounding the discriminatory colour schemes and deceiving navigation buttons were dismissed and the changes were added to the site. As a result of this, the client’s revenue increased, but at the cost of deceiving people and losing their trust.

According to the ACM Code of Ethics, computing professionals must “avoid harm” (Principle 1.2), “be honest” (Principle 1.3), and “treat all people fairly” (Principle 1.4) (ACM, 2018). This act of deceptiveness caused harm to users by tricking them into paying for something they did not intend to buy. This is not an honest way of doing business and using designs which discriminate against those with visual impairments is not a way of treating people fairly. Therefore, the use of dark UX patterns in this case undermines the ethical conduct that computing professionals are obligated to follow, and contradicts the principle of promoting the public good (Principle 1.1).

The BCS Code of Conduct also requires professionals to “have due regard for public health, privacy, security, and wellbeing of others” and “promote equal access to IT” (BCS, 2022). Stewart’s team does not uphold these standards and compromises users’ trust and professionalism.

**Impact on Professionalism:**  
The use of these design patterns tarnishes the image of computing professions by sacrificing ethics for revenue. The client and Stewart’s team harmed their own reputations by contributing to a design choice which does not prioritise transparency and fairness to their users, which are emphasised in the ACM and BCS codes. This act contributes to the ever-growing doubts in digital platforms.

**Legal and Social Implications:**  
Dark UX patterns may go against consumer protection laws, such as the UK’s Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 which forbids misleading practices. The Equality Act 2010 could also be violated due to the colour schemes not providing accessibility for people with disabilities.
