Hello Anda,

Your initial post gives good insight into how easy it is to mislead users and ruin fair competition using dark UX patterns, with references to the Online Choice Architecture (Competition and Markets Authority, 2022) and the EU Digital Services Act (Moore, 2024). This legal viewpoint is essential in labelling this approach of foul play as a violation of consumer rights and completely unethical.

Corporate responsibility behind individual designers is an area that could be further analysed; UX professionals may know what they are doing when it comes to designing, but the leadership teams behind them are the masterminds of the deceptive tactics. Despite the ACM Code of Ethics (2018) highlighting the necessity for harm preventing company policies, enforcement of this rules is not followed through. Companies should have review boards or internal auditors that make sure companies are not making UX changes for deceptive or manipulative reason before implementation.

While the case study focuses on deceptive UI elements, machine learning algorithms can also be used to subtly manipulate consumer choices—for instance, by nudging users toward more expensive options based on past behaviour (Petropoulos, 2022). Future regulatory efforts may need to address not just UI design but also how AI influences decision-making.

The case study focuses on UI elements being deceptive, but it is important to also consider how machine learning algorithms can be used to manipulate users’ decisions. For example, algorithms may encourage consumers to pick the most expensive options based on their past behaviour and usage (Petropoulos, 2022). Future regulatory efforts might need to shift some focus towards how AI influences decision making, as opposed to only UI design
