# Peer Response 2

Hi Andrius,

Your discussion is a strong addition to this study case by your inclusions on accessibility and ethical obligations of UX professionals. Using colours to hide key disclaimers, under guidelines such as WCAG 2.1 (W3C, 2018), is a serious violation. It is vital to be aware of how this can affect users who are visually impaired. Your links to the BCS Code of Conduct (2022) shows perfectly how these acts conflict with professional ethics and integrity.

Psychological impacts of dark UX patterns are often overlooked, despite research suggesting that the use of a deceptive design can cause fatigue, frustration and a lower well-being over time (Mathur et al., 2019). This is especially a concern with the elderly or those who are less IT literate; these vulnerable users often struggle to notice even the most common manipulation techniques and make unintended purchases due to feeling pressured.

Additionally, while you discuss legal responses, enforcement remains a challenge. The FTC’s crackdown on dark patterns (FTC, 2022) and the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill (UK Parliament, 2023) represent progress, but companies often find loopholes by making subtle design tweaks that technically comply with regulations while still nudging users toward unintended actions (Car, 2025). This raises the question: how can legislation be structured to prevent companies from simply adapting deceptive practices rather than eliminating them?

I agree with views on legal responses; however, enforcement still continues to be a major issue. The FTC’s enforcement on dark patterns (FTC, 2022) and the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill (UK Parliament, 2023) shows progress, however, loopholes always seem to be found, and companies continue to make small design tweaks which technically align with regulations, but still influence users to take unintended actions (Boehmer et al., 2023). How can we structure legislation to stop companies finding these loopholes and eradicate deceptive practices all together?
