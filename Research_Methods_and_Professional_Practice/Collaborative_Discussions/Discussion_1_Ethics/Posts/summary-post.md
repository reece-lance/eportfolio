We have been focusing our discussion on the ethical implications of dark UX patterns and how they violate the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics and the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct, for the past 3 weeks. The case study we looked at revolved around Stuart, a web developer that was ordered to integrate deceiving design features with the intention of misleading customers to make accidental purchases. In this discussion, we looked into the legal, social and professional consequences of these unethical acts and gave insight into different ethical processes.

**Ethical Considerations**
The ethical duty of computing professionals to be transparent and fair when designing was a repetitive topic in our discussions. Christopher Butterworth highlighted the importance of whistleblowing in cases when companies intentionally deployed deceptive designs. He also recommended that there should be formal design standards within organisations to help developers to stick to ethical directives only.

Mohammed Younes referenced research from Gray et al. (2018) which expanded on how dark UX patterns do manipulate the behaviour of users and affect trust in digital platforms. He also cited Schaareman (2023) who preaches that constantly being exposed to deceptive interfaces causes an increase in disengagement among users.

**Legal and Social Implications**
We also discussed how dark UX patterns may violate key regulations, many from the UK’s Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 and the Equality Act 2010. The violated laws ensure fair trading prices and accessibility, but enforcing them is still a struggle. I mentioned that it is ethically wrong but legally correct of companies to exploit loopholes but remain legally compliant.

Mohammed also spoke of emerging regulations that address deceptive practices, such as the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill (UK Parliament, 2023). Anda rightly pointed out however, that these measures only focus on explicit UI manipulation and ignore the growing influence of AI-driven decision-making and its ability to draw users towards making decisions without being aware of their actions.

**Professional Responsibility and Alternative Approaches**
It is the responsibility of professionals to not only challenge any practices which are considered unethical, but also advocate for designs that are centred around improving a user’s experience. Christopher spoke of how ethical review boards should be implemented into organisations, with the role of assessing any major design changes to make sure they do not breach any form of ethics or industry standards, before they are implemented.

I discussed with Anda how we could leverage AI and Machine Learning as tools, despite its ability to be used to manipulate users, it can also be implemented with the aim to enhance user transparency, by providing clear and informative decision-making pointers (Petropoulos, 2022). Given that AI has been recently implemented into systems more regularly, ethical governance of AI and the addition of new regulations should be considered in future legal frameworks.

Christopher did scrutinise the use of “The Design of Everyday Things” by Norman & Nielsen (2020) and questioned its relevance. However, he did admit that it discusses the “psychology of graphical user interfaces” and “information about general design principles” – which I would argue is highly relevant to the discussion, given the examples made regarding users being manipulated by deceiving design techniques. These techniques are implemented with the knowledge of how some users’ brains may interact with certain features and an intent to exploit this. Despite this, he did also cite "The Essentials of Interaction Design" by Cooper et al. (2014), which discusses strategies for ethical design choices. This reference is useful for professionals aiming to balance both business interests and the well-being of users.

**Conclusion**
Our discussion highlighted that dark UX patterns are not only unethical but also legally questionable and damaging to user trust. Computing professionals must remain vigilant in upholding ethical standards and resisting corporate pressures that prioritise profit over integrity. As regulations evolve, industry-wide commitments to ethical design, transparency, and user autonomy will be crucial in ensuring that digital platforms serve the public good rather than exploiting users.

Throughout the discussion, it is noted that dark UX patterns are unethical, legally questionable and cause damage to user trust. Professionals must ensure they stick to ethical standards and resist pressure put on them by corporate bosses and co-workers who choose profit over integrity, something Stuart could not do. To ensure digital platforms do no exploit users in the future, ethical design, transparency and user autonomy must be upheld industry-wide.
