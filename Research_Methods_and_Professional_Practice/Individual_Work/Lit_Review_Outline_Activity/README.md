# Literature Review and Research Proposal Outlines

---

## Overview

This activity documents the early planning stages of my two summative assignments: the literature review and the research proposal presentation. While the final outputs are included in the Key Artefacts section, this entry reflects on how the initial outlines guided the development of those pieces and supported my academic planning.

## Literature Review Outline

In the early stages of the module, I selected the topic of *data visualisation in UK highway maintenance* from the Unit 1 list. I drafted an outline to structure my review around key areas such as operational dashboards, predictive analytics, GIS mapping, and accessibility. My plan was informed by my professional experience as a Performance Analyst and aimed to critically assess both academic and industry sources.

Although I did not formally submit the outline for feedback, creating it helped me narrow the scope of the review and structure my argument effectively. It also made it easier to align the writing with the learning outcomes, particularly in terms of evaluating existing literature and considering methodology and stakeholder needs.

## Research Proposal Outline

Building on the same thematic focus, I began outlining a proposal for a research project titled *"Visualising Performance in UK Highway Maintenance: An Analysis of Innovative Approaches."* The outline included:

- A clear research problem related to transparency and engagement in public infrastructure reporting
- Proposed artefact: an interactive dashboard with embedded summary statistics
- Methodological approach: comparative analysis and stakeholder interviews
- Initial timeline and ethical considerations

As with the literature review, I did not submit the outline for formative feedback, but the planning work provided a strong foundation for the presentation. It helped me define research questions, structure the proposal in line with academic expectations, and ensure that ethical implications were addressed early on.

## Reflection

Completing these outlines early in the module was a valuable experience that supported both time management and critical thinking. Although I did not take advantage of the feedback opportunities, the act of outlining helped clarify my research intentions and make later work more efficient.

Going forward, I will aim to use formal outline submissions more strategically â€” not just as planning tools but also as opportunities to receive constructive input that could strengthen my work further.
