# Research Proposal Outline

---

## Overview

This activity involved the creation of a structured outline for my research proposal ahead of the full submission in Unit 10. The aim was to map out the scope, structure, and rationale of my proposed study while ensuring early alignment with academic expectations and the practical demands of research design.

## Proposal Title

**Visualising Performance in UK Highway Maintenance: An Analysis of Innovative Approaches**

---

## Research Context

The outline was developed to extend the topic explored in my literature review, focusing on the role of advanced data visualisation tools — such as dashboards, geospatial mapping, and scenario modelling — in enhancing transparency and stakeholder decision-making in the public infrastructure sector.

---

## Outline Structure

The proposal outline included the following components:

- **Research Problem and Context**  
  An overview of the challenges in performance communication within UK highway maintenance and the opportunity for visualisation to bridge data gaps.

- **Research Question**  
  *How can advanced data visualisation techniques be used to support transparency, decision-making, and stakeholder engagement in the UK highway maintenance sector?*

- **Aims and Objectives**  
  To identify current gaps in visual communication practices, evaluate tools and methods used across sectors, and propose an artefact design to enhance infrastructure reporting.

- **Methodology**  
  A mixed-method approach was proposed, including a comparative review of current practices and qualitative interviews with relevant stakeholders.

- **Ethical Considerations**  
  Key concerns included consent for stakeholder engagement and anonymisation of any internal performance data used in illustrative prototypes.

- **Expected Outputs**  
  A research artefact in the form of a conceptual or working prototype of an interactive dashboard, supported by a timeline of project phases.

## Reflection

Drafting the proposal outline helped solidify the scope and feasibility of my research idea. It also allowed me to start thinking about practical elements such as timelines and ethical review processes early on. The outline provided a helpful framework that I later built upon to produce the full proposal presentation for Unit 10.
