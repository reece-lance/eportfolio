# Research Proposal Review

---

## Overview

This activity reflects on my self-assessment and internal review of the draft version of my research proposal, prior to completing the final submission in Unit 10. Although I did not formally submit this review for feedback, I undertook a structured self-evaluation to ensure the proposal met academic expectations and aligned with the learning outcomes for the module.

## Research Context

The topic for my proposal, *"Visualising Performance in UK Highway Maintenance: An Analysis of Innovative Approaches,"* builds directly on the themes explored in my literature review. The aim was to develop a research project that critically assesses the role of advanced data visualisation techniques in improving transparency, decision-making, and stakeholder engagement in the public infrastructure sector.

## Internal Review and Adjustments

During my review of the draft, I focused on the following areas:

- **Research Clarity**: I refined my research question to ensure it was specific, feasible, and clearly aligned with real-world problems in public infrastructure reporting.
- **Methodological Rigor**: I evaluated whether my proposed mixed-method approach — including comparative analysis and stakeholder interviews — was realistic and appropriately justified.
- **Ethical Considerations**: I ensured that data protection, consent, and anonymisation practices were sufficiently addressed, especially as the project relates to public data.
- **Timeline and Outputs**: I reviewed the project timeline for practicality and revised it slightly to allow more time for stakeholder engagement and artefact design.

These improvements were guided by the assessment criteria provided in the brief and shaped the final proposal presentation submitted in Unit 10.

## Reflection

Although I did not receive peer or tutor feedback on the draft, taking the time to critically assess my own work was a worthwhile exercise. It encouraged me to think more deeply about how I could turn a conceptual idea into a structured, researchable plan. I also became more aware of the importance of aligning methodology and ethical processes with real-world impact — something I intend to carry forward into my MSc project and professional practice.
