# Reflective Piece – Research Methods & Professional Practice

## Introduction

To improve my understanding of academic research and statistical analysis, I have completed a range of learning activities in the Research Methods and Professional Practice module. This reflection of my work and the module uses the Rolfe et al. (2001) paradigm, which uses a three key question structure of “What?”, “So What?” and “What next?”. This approach focuses on my own experiences doing tasks such as literature reviews, research proposals, worksheets on statistical analysis and activities on ethics. The curriculum in this module has helped me to develop as a data scientist and further increased my interest in public sector reporting and visualisation, particularly in highway performance (Smith et al., 2009).

## What?

This module has given me further insight into the realities involved in planning, conducting and reflecting on research, in a practical way (Mortari, 2015). I completed a literature review based on data visualisation within UK highway maintenance, which gave me the foundation for my proposed research, exploring the use of interactive, dynamic dashboards for analysing performance (Nadj, Maedche and Schieder, 2020). I also took part in ethical discussions, critical reflections on professional standards and worksheets on statistical analysis.

The literature review was one of the most vital assignments in the module for my development as it allowed me to collate scholarly and academic publications on visualisation technologies such as GIS and dashboards. I also submitted a research proposal for the development of an interactive dashboard to support performance reporting and decision-making within government and highway maintenance contractors (Office of Rail and Road, 2024). This is something which is related to my position at Marlborough Highways. Furthermore, I completed Excel-based statistical tasks which involved summarising data, building charts and hypothesis testing, improving my ability to interpret findings from real-world situations.

The exercise on ethical thinking in AI governance prompted me to consider the wider societal and professional implications of computing (Consensus, no date); issues of justice, data privacy and all-round openness and how these can relate to public dashboards, generative AI and other tools (FYLD, 2025).

## So What?

The exercises in this module gave me greater confidence in my ability to converge my academic knowledge with real-world requirements. The requirements of the literature review and proposal were to choose a research topic and propose a methodologically sound answer. At first, I struggled to keep critical depth and did not add enough citations throughout. However, my writing was relevant to my position and showed promise; feedback stated there were too many enumerated headings and small lists, and not enough comparisons between tools. This helped in learning the value in paragraph-level criticality and showed how important it is to improve reading literature in groups rather than one at a time (University of West London, no date).

During the proposal stage, I thought more like a researcher than a student, by looking at how being more open with data can help relevant stakeholders. This relates to my objectives, mirroring my intentions for my MSc dissertation, due to the inclusion of researching deadlines, ethical planning and artifact design, in the proposal-building process (Soto, 2024).

The worksheets we completed helped to reinforce my knowledge of many key statistical concepts, including graphical analysis, sample summaries and t-tests. I applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios with confidence during these Excel based exercises and completed them with ease. These tasks resembled the very basics of the building of a dashboard, where summarising trends and validating changes is critical (Kobi, 2024).

The ethical assignments allowed me to look at things with a different perspective to how one may usually look, with more emphasis on how and why ethics should be continuously followed, rather than being seen as a box-ticking requirement (Wentzel, n.d.). The essay I wrote on the governance of AI helped with the application of ethical frameworks such as the BCS Code, GDPR and looking at issues in the industry from bias to algorithmic opacity (Cabinet Office, 2021). Given how my current role involves presenting performance data to public stakeholders, I further reinforced my understanding of the clear ethical burden on me as an IT professional.

## Now What?

When moving forward, I will ensure I take the lessons learnt from this module into both my professional career and MSc project. I will take a more methodical process to literature evaluations by grouping material according to themes and ensuring I incorporate criticism throughout. I will also carry out my plan to create a dynamic dashboard around actual highway findings and data, as discussed with my manager already.

Expanding my statistical skills is also vital, and I will continue to develop my knowledge in both Excel and Python for future analysis. While my confidence was already at a reasonable level, I understand that a stronger foundation in experimental design and testing is something which will improve my work for the future. Furthermore, there are some statistical techniques from this module that I have already began using in my work to help make better decisions in compliance reporting and when monitoring contract performance.

My perspective on professional development since this module has somewhat changed. I now look at research as a dynamic reflective process, rather than just a sequential collection of tasks (Reed et al., 2021). Given the emphasis on ethical reasoning, I will propose better governance of data at my workplace, especially in AI-related activities. I will also advocate for explainability and reasoning in any AI-assisted analytics we may use.

Finally, the skills matrix, SWOT analysis and other reflective elements of the curriculum have inspired me to consider how I can improve my ability and confidence. I have used this insight to prioritise impact, accessibility and ethics in my future project plans for my MSc artefact. I now have better knowledge, navigating academic and professional environments alike with a stronger sense of social responsibility.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I have noticed improvements in my proficiency on a technical level, and awareness of ethics, as a result of using Rolfe et al.'s methodology for reflection. I feel better prepared to tackle the MSc thesis and incorporate data visualisation into a highways maintenance-based artefact, especially given the alignment of my job function and coursework. This module has improved my attitude towards research, ethics and analysis in the computing domain. I have learnt that theory and practice can and should inform each other, especially when digital transformation and public accountability have direct bearing.
