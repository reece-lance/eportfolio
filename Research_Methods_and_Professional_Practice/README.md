# Research Methods & Professional Practice

---

## Module Overview

The Research Methods & Professional Practice module provides a practical foundation in academic investigation and statistical analysis, equipping students with the necessary tools to design, evaluate, and reflect upon research projects in a computing context. Through the exploration of qualitative and quantitative methodologies, ethical considerations, and the role of professional conduct, this module supports the development of both theoretical knowledge and hands-on research competencies. Learners are expected to critically evaluate literature, construct structured research proposals, and reflect on their professional growth throughout the process.

---

## Learning Outcomes

1. Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural and ethical issues that affect computing professionals.  
2. Appraise the principles of academic investigation, applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field.  
3. Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.  
4. Produce and evaluate critically a research proposal for the chosen topic.

### Statistics Exercises

#### Overview

This section presents core statistical analysis activities from Units 8 and 9, covering exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualisation, and statistical testing. Tasks were completed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks and include code walkthroughs, annotated outputs, and discussion of results in relation to research practice.

*[Examples of my work](./Statistics_Work/README.md)*

---

### Literature Review and Research Proposal Evaluation

This section reflects on the development of my literature review and research proposal, evaluating topic selection, feedback received, academic sources, structure, and methodology. The evaluation demonstrates how the proposals align with academic standards and outlines opportunities for refinement.

### Skills Matrix and SWOT Analysis

Presented here is my self-assessment of academic and professional competencies at the beginning of the module, followed by a SWOT analysis and review of progress. This forms part of the broader reflection on my development throughout the module.

### Individual Contributions

A breakdown of my independent work, including statistics exercises, proposal drafting, and reflective evaluation. Screenshots, notebooks, and commentary evidence my ability to apply key principles independently and to professional standards.

#### My Reflections

Key points from my [Full Reflective Piece (1000 words)](./Professional_Development/Reflection.md):

- **Research Ethics:** Gained confidence in navigating ethical concerns and recognising the responsibilities of computing professionals.
- **Statistical Skills:** Developed ability to perform descriptive and inferential statistical analysis using Python.
- **Proposal Writing:** Learned how to construct a coherent and critically evaluated research proposal based on current literature.
- **Professional Self-Awareness:** Built understanding of my personal strengths and limitations through SWOT and skills analysis.
- **Practical Application:** Began applying research planning techniques in other modules and real-world scenarios.
- **Reflective Practice:** Improved ability to think critically about learning processes and future professional development.

#### Professional Skills Gained

I have gained or strengthened the following skills:

- Research design and planning for computing-related topics  
- Quantitative analysis using statistical programming  
- Interpretation of academic literature and peer-reviewed sources  
- Ethical awareness and legal considerations in research  
- Critical thinking and reflective evaluation  
- Professional self-assessment and goal-setting

---

#### Action Plan

To continue building upon this module’s outcomes, I aim to:

- Engage in applied research projects using both qualitative and quantitative methods  
- Continue developing Python skills, especially in data analysis libraries (Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodels)  
- Explore more advanced inferential tests for hypothesis-driven research  
- Strengthen my academic writing and referencing  
- Prepare early for the MSc Capstone by identifying potential artefact-driven topics  
- Seek feedback regularly and integrate reflection into every major project
