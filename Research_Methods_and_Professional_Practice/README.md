# Research Methods & Professional Practice

---

## Module Overview

The Research Methods & Professional Practice module provides a practical foundation in academic investigation and statistical analysis, equipping students with the necessary tools to design, evaluate, and reflect upon research projects in a computing context. Through the exploration of qualitative and quantitative methodologies, ethical considerations, and the role of professional conduct, this module supports the development of both theoretical knowledge and hands-on research competencies. Learners are expected to critically evaluate literature, construct structured research proposals, and reflect on their professional growth throughout the process.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural and ethical issues that affect computing professionals.  
2. Appraise the principles of academic investigation, applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field.  
3. Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.  
4. Produce and evaluate critically a research proposal for the chosen topic.

### Literature Review and Proposal Development

#### Overview

This section includes artefacts and reflections relating to the literature review process and the development of my research proposal. It covers my initial outline, peer-reviewed feedback, and post-submission evaluation. These artefacts demonstrate my ability to formulate and refine a research topic using academic principles and constructive critique.

*[Examples of my work](./Individual_Work/Literature_Review_Outline/README.md)*

#### Feedback Received:
- **Strengths:**
  - Good understanding of structure and relevance of the topic.
  - Appropriate referencing and critical engagement with the literature.
  - Demonstrated understanding of ethical concerns.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Research question could be more focused.
  - More clarity was needed in identifying data sources and collection strategies.

#### Evaluation of Work

The literature review and proposal tasks allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of research strategy, ethical considerations, and the importance of coherent methodology. Feedback encouraged more focus and clarity, which I plan to incorporate into future work.

### Statistics and Analysis Tasks

#### Overview

This section includes my practical work on statistics from Units 8–10. Artefacts include exploratory data analysis, data visualisation, and hypothesis testing. These were completed using Python and support the development of data analysis competence aligned to research design.

### Meeting Notes

A summary of key learning activities and reflective moments during seminars and peer review:

- **Seminar 2 (Peer Review):** Shared draft proposal with peers, received feedback on narrowing the focus of the research question.
- **Seminar 3 (Privacy Case Study):** Discussed issues of data protection and privacy in academic research, reinforcing the importance of anonymisation and secure storage.
- **Seminar 4 (Statistics Workshop):** Explored inferential methods and data interpretation.
- **Unit 11 (e-Portfolio Planning):** Finalised structure and checked alignment with learning outcomes.

### My Reflections

Key points from my [Full Reflective Piece (1000 words)](./Professional_Development/Reflection.md):

- **Ethics & Responsibility:** Gained confidence in ethical approval processes and awareness of responsibilities in research involving human participants.
- **Statistical Development:** Learned how to apply exploratory and inferential statistical techniques to structured data.
- **Academic Research Skills:** Improved ability to identify research gaps, refine questions, and use peer-reviewed literature effectively.
- **Professional Growth:** Used self-assessment tools (SWOT and Skills Matrix) to reflect on strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Practical Application:** Started applying academic research principles to early thinking for my MSc project.

### Professional Skills Gained

I have gained or enhanced the following skills:

- Research design and planning for computing-related investigations  
- Quantitative analysis using Python (pandas, matplotlib, scipy)  
- Literature evaluation and synthesis  
- Ethical awareness and understanding of professional codes  
- Critical reflection and academic writing  
- Time management and independent work  

---

### Action Plan

To build on the skills developed during this module, I plan to:

- Explore more advanced statistical tests relevant to computing and behavioural research  
- Start scoping viable topics for my MSc project with a focus on artefact creation  
- Improve visualisation and presentation of results using libraries such as Seaborn and Plotly  
- Seek peer feedback on future proposal drafts and integrate early ethics considerations  
- Use GitHub e-Portfolios actively to document my ongoing professional development
