# Research Methods & Professional Practice

---

## Module Overview

The Research Methods & Professional Practice module provides a practical foundation in academic investigation and statistical analysis, equipping students with the necessary tools to design, evaluate, and reflect upon research projects in a computing context. Through the exploration of qualitative and quantitative methodologies, ethical considerations, and the role of professional conduct, this module supports the development of both theoretical knowledge and hands-on research competencies. Learners are expected to critically evaluate literature, construct structured research proposals, and reflect on their professional growth throughout the process.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural and ethical issues that affect computing professionals.  
2. Appraise the principles of academic investigation, applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field.  
3. Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.  
4. Produce and evaluate critically a research proposal for the chosen topic.
