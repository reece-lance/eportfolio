# Research Methods & Professional Practice

---

## Module Overview

The Research Methods & Professional Practice module provides a practical foundation in academic investigation and statistical analysis, equipping students with the necessary tools to design, evaluate, and reflect upon research projects in a computing context. Through the exploration of qualitative and quantitative methodologies, ethical considerations, and the role of professional conduct, this module supports the development of both theoretical knowledge and hands-on research competencies. Learners are expected to critically evaluate literature, construct structured research proposals, and reflect on their professional growth throughout the process.

---

## Learning Outcomes

1. Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural and ethical issues that affect computing professionals.  
2. Appraise the principles of academic investigation, applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field.  
3. Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.  
4. Produce and evaluate critically a research proposal for the chosen topic.

### Literature Review and Proposal Development

#### Overview

This section includes the two assignments completed for this module — a written literature review and a research proposal presentation. These artefacts demonstrate my ability to critically engage with academic sources, develop a structured research question, and propose a clear methodology for a future MSc-level research project. Both assessments relate to the topic of data visualisation in the UK highway maintenance sector.

#### Literature Review

**Title**: *Visualising Infrastructure Performance: A Review of Data Visualisation Techniques in UK Highway Management*  
This literature review aimed to provide a structured critical evaluation of current methods, challenges, and tools used to visualise performance data in the UK's road maintenance sector. It explored academic and industry literature covering operational dashboards, predictive analytics, GIS mapping, and accessibility of data for stakeholders. Particular focus was placed on my own practical experiences as a Performance Analyst at Marlborough Highways.

*[Download the Marker Feedback](./Individual_Work/Literature_Review_Outline/Reece_Lance_RRMP_Summative_Feedback_Template_(Literature_Review).pdf)*

#### Feedback Received:
- **Strengths**:
  - Demonstrated very good topic knowledge with clear relevance to practice.
  - Structure was coherent and the writing style showed potential for academic development.
  - Clear attempt to link practical application and industry context.
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Too many disconnected sub-sections and a tendency to “list” points rather than fully develop paragraphs.
  - Limited use of regular citation throughout paragraphs; more consistent source integration was recommended.
  - Needed deeper critical discussion with clearer comparison of views and evidence.

#### Evaluation of Work

This assignment helped strengthen my ability to evaluate academic literature and apply it to a practical problem. It also introduced me to expectations around paragraph-level criticality, frequent in-paragraph citation, and thematic focus. I will take this feedback forward by improving how I structure future academic discussions and how I integrate critique into my writing more effectively.

#### Research Proposal Presentation (30% of module mark)

**Title**: *Visualising Performance in UK Highway Maintenance: An Analysis of Innovative Approaches*  
This presentation proposed a research project that builds directly upon the themes in my literature review. The aim was to investigate how advanced visualisation techniques — such as dashboards, geospatial tools, and scenario modelling — could support transparency, decision-making, and stakeholder engagement in the public highway sector.

The project outlines the problem context, proposed artefact (an interactive dashboard), methodology (cross-sector review, interviews, and comparative analysis), and practical outputs for real-world implementation in line with current government digital transformation goals.

##### Evaluation of Work

Although feedback has not yet been received, the structure and delivery of this proposal followed the assignment brief closely, including coverage of literature, ethical considerations, and the timeline for planned research. This was also a valuable opportunity to practice communicating complex research ideas to a non-specialist audience, which I consider essential for real-world impact.

### Statistics and Analysis Tasks

#### Overview

This section includes my practical work on statistics from Units 8–10. Artefacts include exploratory data analysis, data visualisation, and hypothesis testing. These were completed using Python and support the development of data analysis competence aligned to research design.

### Meeting Notes

A summary of key learning activities and reflective moments during seminars and peer review:

- **Seminar 2 (Peer Review):** Shared draft proposal with peers, received feedback on narrowing the focus of the research question.
- **Seminar 3 (Privacy Case Study):** Discussed issues of data protection and privacy in academic research, reinforcing the importance of anonymisation and secure storage.
- **Seminar 4 (Statistics Workshop):** Explored inferential methods and data interpretation.
- **Unit 11 (e-Portfolio Planning):** Finalised structure and checked alignment with learning outcomes.

### My Reflections

Key points from my [Full Reflective Piece (1000 words)](./Professional_Development/Reflection.md):

- **Ethics & Responsibility:** Gained confidence in ethical approval processes and awareness of responsibilities in research involving human participants.
- **Statistical Development:** Learned how to apply exploratory and inferential statistical techniques to structured data.
- **Academic Research Skills:** Improved ability to identify research gaps, refine questions, and use peer-reviewed literature effectively.
- **Professional Growth:** Used self-assessment tools (SWOT and Skills Matrix) to reflect on strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Practical Application:** Started applying academic research principles to early thinking for my MSc project.
