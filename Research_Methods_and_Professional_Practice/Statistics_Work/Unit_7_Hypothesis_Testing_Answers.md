# Unit 7 – Hypothesis Testing Worksheet Answers

## Exercise 7.1 – One-Tailed Test on Filtration Agents

**Conclusion**:  
Since t = 2.87 > critical value = 1.83 and p = 0.009 < 0.05, we reject the null.  
There is strong evidence that Filter Agent 1 is significantly more effective than Filter Agent 2.

## Exercise 7.2 – Male vs Female Income

**Conclusion**:  
A one-tailed t-test showed a significant difference (p = 0.0073), with males earning more on average  
(approx. £31,438 vs £26,064).  
**Assumptions**:  
- Normal distribution  
- Equal variances  
- Independent samples  
**Validation**:  
- Normality tests (e.g. Shapiro-Wilk)  
- F-test or Levene’s test for equal variances

## Exercise 7.3 – Two-Tailed Test on Filtration Agents

**Conclusion**:  
t = 2.875 > 2.262, p = 0.018 < 0.05 → reject the null.  
There is significant evidence of a difference in mean impurity levels between the two filtration agents.
