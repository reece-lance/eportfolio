## Inference Activity – Unit 8

**Step 1: State the Hypotheses**  
H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ (The population mean weight loss is the same for Diet A and Diet B)  
H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂ (There is a difference in population mean weight loss between Diet A and Diet B)

**Step 2: Set the Criteria for the Decision**  
The significance level used is α = 0.05 (5%).

**Step 3: Compute the Test Statistic**  
From the t-test performed in Excel:  
- Diet A mean = 5.341, SD = 2.536, n = 50  
- Diet B mean = 3.710, SD = 2.769, n = 50  
- The calculated t-statistic was approximately 3.072  
- The two-tailed p-value was approximately 0.0028

**Step 4: Make a Decision**  
Since the p-value (0.0028) is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.  
This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean weight loss between Diet A and Diet B.  
Given that Diet A had the higher mean weight loss, it appears to be more effective.

**Conclusion:**  
This analysis supports the conclusion that Diet A is more effective than Diet B for weight loss, based on the sample data provided. These results should be interpreted in the context of assumptions such as normally distributed data and equal variances between groups.
