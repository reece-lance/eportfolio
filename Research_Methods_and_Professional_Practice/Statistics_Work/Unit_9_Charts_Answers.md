## Exercise 9.1 – Brand Preferences in Area 2

**Task:**  
Open the Excel workbook in `Exe 9.1D.xlsx`. Add a percentage frequency bar chart showing brand preferences in Area 2 using the same format as the Area 1 chart.

**Chart:**

**Interpretation:**  
Area 2 respondents show slightly higher preferences for Brands A and B compared to Area 1, while "Other" brands remain the most popular in both demographics. This could indicate more diverse preferences or a weaker brand presence in Area 1.

## Exercise 9.2 – Heather Species in Two Locations

**Task:**  
Open the Excel workbook in `Exe 9.2E.xlsx`. Create a clustered column chart to compare species prevalence across the two locations.

**Chart:**

**Interpretation:**  
The chart reveals notable differences in species distribution between locations. Some heather species appear to dominate one site more than the other, possibly indicating differing environmental conditions or conservation efforts.

## Exercise 9.3 – Diet A Weight Loss Distribution

**Task:**  
Open the Excel workbook in `Exe 9.3B.xlsx`. Add a relative frequency histogram of Diet B weight loss using the same class intervals as for Diet A.

**Chart:**

**Interpretation:**  
Diet B exhibits a more even distribution of weight loss, whereas Diet A shows a more concentrated central tendency. This suggests that Diet A may be more consistent in outcome, while Diet B shows a wider variation in effectiveness.

## Exercise 9.4 – Describe Area 2 Brand Preferences

**Answer:**  
Brand B is the most preferred in Area 2 (approx. 33.3%), followed by "Other" (45.6%) and then Brand A (21.1%). This differs from Area 1 where "Other" dominates at 60%. This suggests Area 2 may have stronger loyalty or better marketing presence for specific brands.

---

## Exercise 9.5 – Compare Brand Preferences

**Answer:**  
Comparing Areas 1 and 2, Brand B sees the most notable increase in Area 2. Brand A also sees an increase, while "Other" sees a sharp decline. This indicates Area 2 may have more defined brand preferences, unlike Area 1 which is more dispersed.

---

## Exercise 9.6 – Compare Weight Loss Distribution

**Answer:**  
Diet B’s histogram shows a broader distribution compared to Diet A. There’s less concentration around the mean, suggesting Diet B leads to a more variable weight loss outcome. In contrast, Diet A tends to cluster around 5–7kg losses, indicating a more predictable performance.
